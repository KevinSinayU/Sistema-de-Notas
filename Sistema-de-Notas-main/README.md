- `Your MySQL database user and password`: to change the application properties.
- `Your MySQL database name`: if the database does not exist it will create it.
- `The path to the Spring Boot and React files`: to run the application.
  
To run the script, first navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then make sure that you have the execute permission for the script by running **chmod +x run_app.sh**. Finally execute the script using the command **./run_app.sh**
  
However, you can manually run the application, just be sure to change the following things on the **application.properties** file, wich is located on the Backend folder, on **src/main/resources**: 

- `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db`: change your_db to the name of your existing database.

- `spring.datasource.password=your_password`: change your_password to your mySQL password.

<p>Once you changed this things, you can execute the app. First make sure that your DATABASE server is on. Then run the Spring Boot application, you can run it for example on an IDE as IntellijIDEA. Finally, you can run the React app by using the command npm start on the react directory.</p>
